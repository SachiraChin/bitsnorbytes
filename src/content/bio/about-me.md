## About me

A software engineer born in [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka), live in the United States at the moment. I have been working with `.NET Platform` for around 8 years. My first programming language was `Visual Basic 6`, learned `C` and `Java` in university days, but became a full-time Software Engineer for `.NET Platform` after that. During my tenure as a Software Engineer, apart from the above platforms, I've worked on `SharePoint`, `Xamarin`, `iOS apps with Objective-C` projects.

At the moment, I see myself as a full-stack Software Engineer, I develop applications based on `.NET` server-side while using `Angular`/`React` client-side. I work mostly with `Azure` for cloud application development and deployments while using `GitHub` and/or `Azure DevOps` for CI/CD.
